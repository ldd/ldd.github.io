<ul>
<li id="question0"><b>Q: What is this game?</b></li>
A simulation game inspired by pre-Inca civilizations, and set in a fictional South America.<br>
You play as the world map, and indirectly control characters, as they die, find treasure and adventure.

<li id="question1"><b>Q: What games inspired it?</b></li>
A: A mix of Gnomoria and Rimworld in terms of mechanics and gameplay.
A little bit of Towns in organization, and a lot of Dwarf fortress in inspiration and passion from its developers.

<li id="question2"><b>Q: Technology?</b></li>
A: HTML5 + WebGL (JavaScript). 

<li id="question2"><b>Q: Platform?</b></li>
Desktop-only browser.

<li id="question3"><b>Q: Why not mobile? Tablet?</b></li>
A: I can't compete against the free-to-play model on mobile. Additionally, this would steal time from the desktop version.

<li id="question4"><b>Q: Will it have multiplayer, will it find me a date for Thursday or clean my room?</b></li>
A: No

<li id="question5"><b>Q: x failed. Why should I trust you?</b></li>
You shouldn't. For now, you can't even donate.<br> 
I want to be brutally honest: most games of this genre fail, for a variety of reasons.
I want to minimize my chances of failure. <br>
To do so, I will not allow people to give any amount of money until there is an actual game that can be played. If/when that happens, I will make sure that everyone understands that this project could be cancelled at any time.<br>
That being said, it will not be cancelled. It is called prelude for a reason.

<li id="question6"><b>Q: OK. Why prelude?</b></li>
A: In this first try, I want to explore the mechanics that make or break this genre. It is a relatively unexplored genre, and I think it is best to limit my expectations for now.

<li id="question7"><b>Q: When will you engage with the community?</b></li>
A: If I have trouble implementing something, I'll let you know. <br>
Thursdays I will answer questions and contemplate suggestions. This is not my dream game. But it is an awesome and essential part of everything I need to be able to make it.

<li id="question8"><b>Q: Can I monetize videos of Maggies:Prelude?</b></li>
A: For sure!
