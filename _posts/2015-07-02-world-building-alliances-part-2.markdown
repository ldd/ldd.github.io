It's around 11:30PM here, so that means I am technically still writing this on Thursday.

Last week I tried to write about the ongoing efforts to add alliances to the world. At the time, 
there were entities that could settle (form an alliance) or just wander around the world map.

Early this week I was able to make it possible for entities to *join* one of these alliances.
In fact, I am fairly confident that I will be able to expand on the basic behaviour that entities have.

Next week, I'll focus on attack (and simple item drops) in order to eventually add trade.

The plan for the next two weeks is relatively simple: basic attack and basic trade.
