This will be an even shorter weekly update but I have been stuck this weekly
trying to handle enemy alliances and combat.

Combat right now follows a basic FFXII-like gambit system, where the health is not in HP (hit points)
but as a function of the state of internal organs of an entity.

So next week I will entirely focus on combat and by then I should have a public trello that anyone can follow.

I plan to add a board for 'minimal functionality needed' which will contain features needed to show people in game development circles my game. Additionally, there will be features that are needed for the next milestone and so on and so forth until I have an actual playable game!
